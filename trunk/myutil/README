MY UTIL Package:
----------------
A package for commonly used data structures, I'll add them 
as I use them. Currently I have the following

1. RQsort (Randomized Quick sort)
2. List
3. Hash
4. Heap (Added 02/28/08)

TODO:
-----
1. Graph algorithms
2. More data structures
	2.1 Skip lists
	2.2 2-3 tree
3. Sorting (Frazer McKeller)

Next Data Structure Scheduled is 2-3 Tree, Skip Lists.

NOTE ON WRITING COMPARISION ROUTINES:(June 05,2008)
------------------------------------
A Comparision Routine is usually provided by the
user of the data structure. For example for the
binary-heap we have "char (*KeyCompare)(void *a,void *b)"
if any of the arguments is null make sure your code returns
the non-null address.
