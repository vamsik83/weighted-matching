This directory contains the implementation of a weighted matching algorithm.


BUILDING:

To build on a 64-bit machine run: "make -f Makefile PF=x84_64", to build on other platforms see the corresponding Makefiles. This should generate an 
executable named "bipartite1-linux64". To build on MAC just use "make -f Makefile PF=x84_64" (make sure you have g++ and XCode installed).

RUNNING:

The program reads a sparse matrix representation of the weighted bipartite graph, the sparse matrix should be in a "Row Compressed Format". Now you 
can run the program "./bipartite1-linux64 {sparse_matrix.txt}"
